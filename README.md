# ⚛️ Far Away — Travel Packing List App

Far Away is a simple and handy web app designed for travelers. It helps you organize your packing by allowing you to:

- ➕ **Add items** you want to bring on your trip.
- ✔️ **Check off items** as you pack them, so you never forget anything.
- 🔀 **Sort your packing list** by item name, description, or whether it’s packed.
- 🗑️ **Clear the entire list** once you're done packing all your items.

Built with React using functional components and the `useState` hook, Far Away offers a smooth and intuitive experience for managing your travel essentials.

Pack smarter, travel farther!
